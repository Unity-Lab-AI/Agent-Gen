# FINALIZED — Permanent Task Archive

Permanent archive of every completed task. Per `.claude/CONSTRAINTS.md §NEVER DELETE TODO INFO` + `§FINALIZED BEFORE DELETE`, no entry is EVER deleted from this file. New entries APPEND only.

Per LAW #0, every entry includes the user's verbatim words from the original ask.

Each session entry includes:
- `## Session <YYYY-MM-DD>` — date heading
- Verbatim user quote
- Files touched
- Closure notes (what shipped, verification)

## Session 2026-05-09

### Statusline label adapts to /rename + auto-color per session

**Verbatim user quote:** "The color of the project name should auto-update if the color for the session has been set to match that, and if named using the rename should reflect there as well, can you make that change?"

**Verbatim user follow-up:** "I also just set the color and name so re-check potentially the global .claude and the project level .claude"

**Verbatim user palette decision:** "Random selection of a color then" (selected via AskUserQuestion after empirical confirmation that `/color` doesn't persist anywhere readable to the statusline script).

**Files touched:**
- `.claude/statusline.sh` — Python block parses `session_name` + `session_id` from stdin JSON; label = renamed value or cwd basename fallback; color = MD5(session_id) → 12-color ANSI palette when renamed, magenta `35` when not. `LABEL` exported via eval, replaces hardcoded `${B}[${PROJECT_NAME}]${R}`. `B`/`R` dead vars removed.
- `docs/STATUSLINE.md` — added §8.5 "Label & color — auto-adapt to /rename" documenting the new rules + why hash-based instead of /color (verified empirically that `/color` doesn't persist). Removed `session_name` row from §9 brainstorm table since it's now shipped; added inline ✓ implemented note pointing to §8.5.

**Closure notes:**
- Empirically verified Claude Code 2.1.138 does NOT expose `/color` value to the statusline JSON (captured live JSON via stdin tee, checked `~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`, project `.claude/`). Documented in code comments + §8.5.
- 4 test scenarios passed: (a) renamed `UnityWorkflow` + real session_id → bright green palette slot, (b) different session_id → blue (different hash), (c) no rename → cwd basename + magenta (original behavior preserved), (d) broken JSON → magenta fallback label + `?` for ctx/model.
- Branch: `feature/extra-status-bar-features` off `develop`. Atomic commit will bundle code + doc per `§DOCS BEFORE PUSH` LAW.
